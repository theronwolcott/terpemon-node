  "prompt": "Overall Aesthetic\nCartoonish & Playful: The creatures are lighthearted, colorful, and expressive — clearly meant for a fun, child-friendly context rather than anything scary or grotesque.\n\nRounded Shapes: The forms are soft and bulbous, with few sharp edges. Limbs are rubbery and exaggerated, contributing to a whimsical feel.\n\nColor Palette: Bright, saturated, and high-contrast colors dominate (e.g., neon greens, blues, pinks, oranges, reds, purples). Colors are often used to create visual contrast between body and features like eyes, mouths, or hair.\n\nFacial Features\nEyes:\nCommonly multiple eyes (ranging from 1 to 10+).\nSome eyes are directly on the head/body, others on extended stalks.\nEyelashes are frequently used, often exaggerated.\nIris and pupils are large, with black pupils and white sclera. Eyes are highly expressive.\n\nMouths:\nWide mouths with large, triangular teeth (mostly white or yellow).\nOften open with visible gums/tongue; sometimes the mouth is massive compared to the face.\nSmiles and emotions are exaggerated and readable — creatures often look happy, surprised, or curious.\n\nNoses:\nNone of the creatures have visible noses, which simplifies the face and emphasizes eyes and mouth.\n\nBody Styles and Textures\nVariety of Forms:\nSome creatures are amorphous blobs or slimes.\nOthers are egg-shaped, furry, or have distinct limbs and torsos.\nThere is a good mix of bipedal creatures, tentacled blobs, and tailed designs.\n\nTextures:\nSome are slimy or glossy (e.g., smooth with reflections).\nOthers are fuzzy or furry (represented with soft tufts or lines).\nFreckles, dots, or patterns are used to break up solid colors and add visual interest.\n\nArms, Legs, and Appendages\nLimbs:\nArms are thin and noodle-like, usually ending in rounded fingers or mitten-like hands.\nLegs vary — some are stubby and paw-like, others are long and gangly. Many creatures don't have clearly defined feet.\nSome arms are tentacle-like or end in pom-pom or claw forms.\n\nTails and Other Features:\nTails may be small and stubby or long and expressive.\nMany creatures have unique appendages — e.g., eyestalks, wings, horn-like ears, or decorative tufts.\n\nHead and Hair Features\nHair and Horns:\nHair is either a tuft (usually a different color), curly string-like tendrils, or leafy/fluffy sprigs.\nSome creatures have ears or wings attached to their heads instead of traditional horns.\n\nHead Shapes:\nOften an extension of the body (no visible neck), sometimes with a very round or dome-like silhouette.\n\nUnique Traits (Optional but Consistent)\nAsymmetry: Some creatures have asymmetrical features (like one eye stalk or uneven arms).\nDetached Eyes or Parts: A few have eyes growing from strange places (e.g., arm, tail) or extra facial parts.\nMouth/Face Positioning: Mouths are sometimes low on the body or off-center, adding a quirky charm.\n\nDesign Tips for Creating a New Matching Creature\nStart with a simple, exaggerated shape (blobby, round, egg-shaped, etc.).\nPick 1–3 bright, contrasting colors for body, eye(s), and details like spots or hair.\nChoose a unique eye configuration: e.g., a single giant eye, multiple tiny eyes, eyes on stalks.\nAdd a big expressive mouth with bold teeth.\nConsider 1–2 accessories or details (e.g., spikes, horns, fuzzy arms, stubby wings).\nMaintain the cartoon style: no harsh lines, shadows, or gradients — keep it flat and vibrant."
